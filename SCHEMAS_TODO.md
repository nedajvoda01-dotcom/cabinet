# Schemas and validation TODO

Autocontent Spec.htm is not present in the repository. The required schema, validation, and WebSocket payload definitions cannot be transcribed until the spec file is available.

## Blockers
- Add `Autocontent Spec.htm` to the repository (expected at `cabinet/Autocontent Spec.htm`).
- Re-run extraction to map modules (Parser, Photos, Export, Publish, Robot, Cards, Auth, Users, Admin) to their request/response/WS schemas once the spec is present.
